# Merry Christmas!

This mod is meant as joke. To play it, create a new Minecraft instance (I can't
guarantee it won't break stuff if you use an existing instance) with Minecraft
1.20.4 and install Fabric loader v0.15.3 and a matching version of Fabric API,
and then add this mod and launch the game. Then have fun!
